TIME TAKEN: 25 minutes

Readability: This part of code has high readability. The variables are named descriptively, 
and the logic easy to understand. For example, ¡¯damageCooldownDuration¡¯ and ¡®damageCooldownTimer¡¯, 
the intent of the code is expressed more intuitively. Besides, the reasonable use of blank lines makes the logic blocks more distinct, 
and comments provide important explanatory information, making it easy for everyone to read and understand.

Code Quality: This part of code shows good practices of modularity and reusability. 
The responsibility for Link PH value and item inventory is clearly separated from the rest of the logic. 
Decomposing the item effects and encapsulated properties of UseItem improves the flexibility of the code structure, 
and allows the system to expand easily as game become complex.
