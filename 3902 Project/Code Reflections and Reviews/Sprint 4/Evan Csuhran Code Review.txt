# CODE REVIEW
* AUTHOR: EVAN CSUHRAN
* DATE: 11/12/24
* SPRINT #4
* FILE NAME: EnemyManager.cs
* FILE AUTHOR: GARY ZHU
* TIME TAKEN: ~ 10 minutes

# READABILITY:
* Could use a bit of more commenting, but is overall easy to follow.
* Also, the formatting is consistent with other managers.
* The section of resetting the direction based on collision is pretty messy.

# CODE QUALITY:
* The code quality is messy with how its doing the re-directing with Collision of enemies on each enemy sprite.
* In terms of using and sending Collision boxes, could use a rework (I'm currently reworking/refactoring the collision)

# FEELINGS ABOUT SPRINT:
* Again, we all kinda got burnout. Then, we all were seperated for most of the sprint in terms of code/communication.
* So, this turn-in was kinda just a big merge of many different approaches, for example, I was working on a Link Refactor, but last minute we decided 
to just stick with the old Link setup, since everyone else was working on that version (to not have one person keepign everyone behind).
* Overall, I think we kinda have a mess, but it's not entirely impossible to clean up (I'm making progress on the collision tho).
