Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

Since I take review of this code, 
I felt this code have a really good strucuture and clear variable name. 
I can clearly understand the functionallity of different constructors and classes. 
One thing need to get improved GetOneRectanglePosition because it take toom many breaks and swithc cases. 
It will be better to seperate this method in two different methods and make it more reable. 

Quality

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In my view, I think this code have a really good quality and include all of functionnalities that render list needed.
Then, I felt like GetOneRectanglePosition could be get seperate in different classes and make it more readable.
